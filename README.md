# Daycare Face Recognition
Summer project creating a 1:K face recognition system to aid a local home daycare business.

Utilized the following:
  * Google's FaceNet model
  * Wireless IP security camera
  * OpenCV
  * Bluetooh speaker
  * Lots of Python!

We were able to design, implement, and iterate on a system that can accurately identify 1 of 6 individuals. These include ourselves, the daycare owner and one employee, as well as parents who volunteered to be a part of this project.

Check out our video demo of the working system!
